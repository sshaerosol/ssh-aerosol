Within this directory, there exist files that deviate from the standard version employed for GENOA reduction.

## Usage Guidelines
During the compilation of ssh-aerosol, kindly incorporate the "-g=yes" or "-genoa=yes" option.
By doing so, ssh-aerosol will undergo compilation utilizing the files situated in the subsequent path: src/include/genoa.
Please noted that the compile "-c" option will be using "genoa" complusorily.

## Distinctions from the Conventional SSH-aerosol Version

### CHEMISTRY
All chemistry files generated by GENOA will be updated in the CHEMISTRY/genoa directory.
The subroutine ssh_chem within CHEMISTRY/common is presently inapplicable, as certain essential features required for GENOA reduction have yet to be implemented with the ROS2 solver.

### SPACK
This particular version of SPACK does not yield any output; it exclusively generates files for the two-step chemical solver.
