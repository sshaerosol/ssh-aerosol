Spack: Spack Chemical Model Generator 
=====================================

For generating the chemistry models
------------------------------------

$ cd SparseLU
$ get_chem_files NAMSPECIES REACTIONS (for the gas-phase chemistry)
$ get_chem_files-siream NAMSPECIES REACTIONS (for the aerosol chemistry)

where NAMSPECIES and REACTIONS are resp. the list of species and reactions to be computed (see in the Spack/Mechanism/ directory).

Then you have in the fortran_codes/ directory all the routines in fortran you need for Polair3D chemistry)..


Note
-----
Spack comes with Talos and SeldonData libraries included.
If there is a need to get the latest release of these libraries,
they can be fetched with:
$ cd include
$ rm -fr Talos
$ git clone http://git.gitorious.org/polyphemus/talos.git ./Talos
$ rm -fr SeldonData
$ git clone http://git.gitorious.org/polyphemus/seldondata.git ./SeldonData
