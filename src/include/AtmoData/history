o------------------o

Version 1.5.2 (2018-04-10)
-------------

** Improvements:
- Fixed GCC warnings.
- Fixed a bug: MM5 coordinate transformations could divide zero by zero.
- Added interpolation functions based on the Chimere code.
- Converted text files to utf-8.
- Fixed compilation warnings.

Version 1.5.1 (2015-09-01)
-------------

** Improvements:

- Added new functions for MACC boundary conditions
  preprocessing.

Version 1.5 (2015-04-20)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added MEGAN biogenic emission model.
- Added new functions for optical and aerosol calculations.
- Renamed 'ComputeCloudHeight' to 'ComputeCloudBaseHeight', and added
  'ComputeCloudTopHeight'.
- Updated formula for the Lambert conformal conic projection.
- Better split header files and source files.

** Bug fix:

- The include guard of "Format.cxx" was the same as the include guard of
  "Format.hxx".
- There was a dimension overflow in a Blitz array (It was harmless because the
  array is not used in this version of AtmoData).


Version 1.4.3 (2010-11-03)
-------------

** Bug fix:

- Fixed a bug: the total number of LUC cells at the boundary of the
  computational domain was erroneous in 'GridCorrespondences'.


Version 1.4.2 (2010-05-07)
-------------

** Bug fix:

- In the function 'LonLatToWRFLccInd', the index along the north-south
  direction was erroneous.


Version 1.4.1 (2010-04-27)
-------------

** Bug fix:

- The function 'ComputeAttenuation_LWC' miscalculated the attenuation when
  clouds reached the upper model level.


Version 1.4 (2009-11-09)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added coordinates transformations:
   + LonlatToWRFLccInd
   + LonlatToWRFMercInd
   + LonlatToWRFStereInd
- Added two overloaded meteorological functions 'ComputeTemperature'.

** Bug fix:

- The operators () of the classes defined for MM5 in "CoordTransform.cxx" were
  shifted with an offset of 0.5 cell.


Version 1.3.2 (2008-05-08)
-------------

** Bug fix:

- Fixed a bug in 'ComputeTotalCloudiness': the numbers of points along x and y ('Nx' and 'Ny') were wrongly set.


Version 1.3.1 (2008-04-22)
-------------

** Bug fix:

- 'FormatMM5::ReadField(ifstream& FileStream)' could fail on huge input files.


Version 1.3 (2007-10-09)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added a potential speciation for SOX.
- Improved 64-bit portability of 'FormatMM5::ReadField(ifstream& FileStream)'.


Version 1.2.1 (2007-06-22)
-------------

** Bug fixes:

- The current date was badly updated inside time loops.


Version 1.2 (2007-04-24)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added functions which compute nucleation and coagulation kernels for
  aerosols.
- Added functions to compute stability class with Pasquill formula in
  "Meteorology.cxx".
- Improved computation of anthropogenic emissions: an error message is thrown
  if there is an unknown country code in the emission inventory, and
  inventories for 10 or 11 sectors can now be used.
- Added files "TimeDiagnosis.hxx" and "TimeDiagnosis.cxx". They contain
  functions to compute the sun declination, hours of sunrise and sunset, and
  to diagnose whether it is night or day at a given time and place.
- Improved the management of the second underscore appended to given Fortran
  external identifiers; introduced 'POLYPHEMUS_SINGLE_UNDERSCORE' and
  'POLYPHEMUS_DOUBLE_UNDERSCORE'.

** Bug fixes:

- A segmentation fault occurred when a country code was unknown.
- An error occurred when a country number was higher than a maximum number of
  countries.


Version 1.1 (2006-09-29)
-----------

** Improvements:

- All functions related to anthropogenic emissions (previously part of
  Polyphemus preprocessing) are now in AtmoData.
- Added functions related to Troen & Mahrt parameterization for vertical
  diffusion coefficients ('ComputeLMO', 'ComputePBLH_TM', 'ComputePBLH_Richardson'
  and 'ComputeTM_Kz').
- Added ESQUIF parameterization for attenuation.
- Improved 'ReadEmep' (less CPU time consuming).
- Only a part of the emissions of NH3 are now taken into account due to the
  local deposition.
- Added "Aerosol.f" and "Meteorology.f" in AtmoData.
- Aggregation matrix is now limited to NMVOC in function
'SpeciationAggregation'.

** Bug fixes:

- Virtual temperature was badly computed.
- Fixed a bug in 'ComputeCloudFraction': when both the relative humidity and the
  critical relative humidity reached 1.0, a division by zero occurred (and the
  cloud fraction was then set to NaN).


Version 1.0 (2004-10-13)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added 'ComputeAttenuation_LWC' to compute the cloud attenuation.
- Added 'ComputeWesely' which computes deposition velocities according to
  the Wesely (1989) model.

  biogenic emissions.
- Added the class 'FormatMM5' to read MM5 files.
- Added coordinates transformations:
   + LaeaToLonlat
   + MM5LccIndToLonlat / LonlatToMM5LccInd
   + MM5MercIndToLonlat / LonlatToMM5MercInd
   + MM5StereIndToLonlat / LonlatToMM5StereInd
- 'LouisKz' was improved and renamed into 'ComputeLouisKz'.
- Added meteorological functions:
   + ComputePressure

** Bug fixes:


Version 0.3 (2003-08-04)
-----------

** Improvements:
