    Use TRY and END to catch exceptions:

    Code that could throw an exception.

    END;

    If an exception is caught, explanations are displayed to identify
    the problem (name of the involved function and comments).

    They are disabled with the 'TALOS_DEBUG' macros to allow for debugging
    exceptions.
