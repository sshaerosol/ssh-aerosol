# Reasons why 'BUILD_TARGETS' is directly managed:
#  - Several targets can be deduced from the command line options
#     Example: scons mpi=* openmp=* my_algo
#       Despite that a single target was given, namely 'my_algo', this line
#       builds all the possible parallelization with automatic executable
#       renaming into "my_algo-mpi", "my_algo-omp" and "my_algo-mpi-omp".
#  - No need to specify '.exe' when building on Windows
#     (Yes, under Windows, '.exe' has to be added to the target name in
#      the scons command line)
