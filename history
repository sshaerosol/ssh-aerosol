# SSH-aerosol version 1.2.1 release (2021-03-01)


## Model

- Add the two-step time numerical solver for gas-phase chemistry
- Correct the reallocation of the vectors in unifac.cxx

## Interface 

- Add a python example for the shared library
- Added new functions in API including get_tag_external

## Fixed bugs

- Correct bug on computation of coagulation
- Correct bug on initialization when aqueous and organic phases are coupled
- Fixed missing initialization of some variables
- Correct bug for water content of sections lower than ICUT


# SSH-aerosol version 1.2 release (2020-11-30)

## Model

- Added generic organic aerosol species. A generic species can be used when a particular species, which needs to be modeled, is not found in SSH-aerosol. Using some provided information about the species (smiles code, saturation vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, molar mass, etc...), SSH-aerosol will automatically create a new generic species during the computation. The generic species can be used to easily add a new organic species in SSH-aerosol. The smiles code will be used to automatically estimate the decomposition into UNIFAC functionnal groups. 
- ICUT (to distinguish bulk equilibrium and dynamic approach) differentiated form inorganics and organics (see the variable ICUT_org).
- Allow coagulation if aerosols are made of different layers.
- Added the peroxyacetyl acid, PAN, peroxide groups for the computation of activity coefficients in SOAP
- For organic compounds, added the possibility to store the aqueous and the organic concentrations separately (see  the variable i_hydrophilic).
- Multiple changes regarding the computation of ICUT using the c/e time scale, the ETR solver efficiency, and the weighted QSSA methods.
- Oligomerization of organics species can be taken into account (with a second-order reversible reaction unfavored by humid conditions) based on [Couvidat et al. (2018)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/15743/2018/).

## Test case

- New test case for oligomerization.
- Improved CPU time for cases where dynamic condensation and coagulation are considered.

## Interface 

- Modified ModuleAPI for the implementation to Polair3d.
- Modified and corrected fortran Interface for the implementation to any fortran programs.
- Improved CPU time for coagulation.
- Added the possibility to gain CPU time by computing surface equilibrium concentrations only once per time (for second order solver).
- Added input file for meteorological data.

## Fixed bugs

- Fixed condensation rate for hydrophobic species.
- Corrected bug for computation of wet diameter for mixing-state resolved particles with a cutoff diameter between dynamic and equilibrium sections.


* Version 1.1 release (2020-05-03)

  + Model
    - Improved redistribution methods.
    - Improved the computation of wet diameter, especially for cases of
      coagulation only.
    - Added the possibility to condense low-volatility compounds dynamically,
      even if full equilibrium is assumed for semi-volatile compounds.
      That improves the computation of the growth of ultrafine particles.
    - Improved mass conservation for evaporation.

  + Test case
    - New test case with cutoff diameter between dynamic and equilibrium size
      sections.
    - Nucleation with condensation of a low-volatility organic.
    - Exhaust test case with ammonia emission, with or without isoprene forming SOA.
      
  + Interface
    - Added implementation examples to use shared library and Fortran 90 module.
    - Makefile added to compile with make.
    - Reduced namelist.ssh to hide some options and input data which should
      not be modified.

* Version 1.0 release (2019-10-09)
