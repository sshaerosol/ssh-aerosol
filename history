* Version 1.1 release (2020-05-03)

  + Model
    - Improved redistribution methods.
    - Improved the computation of wet diameter, especially for cases of
      coagulation only.
    - Added the possibility to condense low-volatility compounds dynamically,
      even if full equilibrium is assumed for semi-volatile compounds.
      That improves the computation of the growth of ultrafine particles.
    - Improved mass conservation for evaporation.

  + Test case
    - New test case with cutoff diameter between dynamic and equilibrium size
      sections.
    - Nucleation with condensation of a low-volatility organic.
    - Exhaust test case with ammonia emission, with or without isoprene forming SOA.
      
  + Interface
    - Added implementation examples to use shared library and Fortran 90 module.
    - Makefile added to compile with make.
    - Reduced namelist.ssh to hide some options and input data which should
      not be modified.
